# Horror Story
===========

A conding challenge for Java courses.

## Material

For each pair, you need a computer with Eclipse and a connection to the Internet. You also need a beamer, to show the code and comment on it before starting the challenge.

## Notes

The challenge can last from 15 to 45 minutes, depending on the participants' knowledge of Java.

Optional: before the challenge, open the online log (at _http://http://microlog.herokuapp.com_) and reset it (by sending an _HTTP DELETE_ to the same address). Keep in mind that the log is global - I'm assuming that only one person at a time will issue the challenge. If you want your own log, you can use the Ruby project at _https://github.com/nusco/microlog_.

## Challenge Intro (12 minutes)

* Form teams of two and sit them at their computers.
* Ask them to open Eclipse.
* Ask each team to pick a name (should be a single word, no "strange" characters).
* Distribute the code.
* Ask teams to create a new project in Eclipse and point it to the existing source code.
* Ask teams to edit file _team.txt_ and put their own name in.
* Tell teams that they can look at the code, but they shouldn't change anything yet.
* Show the source code and explain the challenge.
* Explain the three rules:
	1. You have 45 minutes.
	2. Never, _ever_ edit *HorrorStory.java*, nor *Challenge.java*.
	3. The first team who gets to 10 points (or the team with the most points at the end) wins.
* Show prizes for winning team and runner-up team, if any.
* Tell them that they should always run *Challenge.java* and follow instructions.
* Run *Challenge.java* and show the result.
* Tell them that they have to make the code compile first.
* Tell them about Eclipse's "quick-fix" feature, and how to use it (shortcut, context menu).
* Solicit and answer questions.
* Repeat the three rules.
* Go!
